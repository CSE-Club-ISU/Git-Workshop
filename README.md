# Git-Workshop
An attendance list for our Git Workshop meeting


# Before you start
Slides from the meeting can be found at: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nh1RKK5nhOU8-vdKTfimoBR_49lVxeMrNvdd5hjIVgA/edit?usp=sharing
Go to https://learngitbranching.js.org and work through a couple problems until you feel comfortable with the commands we went over today.
Make sure that you have installed git on your computer.

# Goal
Everybody should add their name to the attendance.txt file.

# Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local computer - this is a straightforward process, but we did not go over it on purpose. Use the GitHub documentation and google to learn how to do this. Knowing how to google correctly is extremely important. 

# Create and checkout a new branch
Create a branch to add your name. Make sure that the branch is up to date.

# Add your name to the file 
Use a text editor of your choice.

# Stage, commit, and push your changes
Use the add, commit, and push commands to do this. Add a message to your commit like "Adding firstname lastname to the attendance list" (-m flag).

# Merge your changes into the main branch
Make sure you have an up to date version of the main branch before pushing. Otherwise you will have merging issues, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. You can use the GitHub merge conflict GUI to resolve the issue, or you can pull the latest changes into your local branch and then push. Close your branch when your merge into main. 

# The end
Git is a critical tool for software engineers. Knowing the basics is important. You can learn more by practicing on your own. Use the site linked above or make your own repository and add branches, commit to them, and merge them. Have fun!
