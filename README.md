# Git-Workshop
An attendance list for our Git Workshop meeting


# Before you start
Slides from the meeting can be found at: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1nh1RKK5nhOU8-vdKTfimoBR_49lVxeMrNvdd5hjIVgA/edit?usp=sharing
Go to https://learngitbranching.js.org and work through a couple problems until you feel comfortable with the commands we went over today.
Make sure that you have installed git on your computer. This read me is not a perfect guide, there may be issues that you run into. Using google to work through is helpful for learning, but feel free to ask if you have any questions.

# Goal
Everybody should add their name to the attendance.txt file. Doing this will make sure everyone is familiar with the basics of Git and the process of making changes to a repository. 

# Fork the repository
Similar to the process here: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request

# Clone the repository
Clone the repository to your local computer - this is a straightforward process, but we did not go over it on purpose. Use the GitHub documentation and google to figure this out. Knowing how to google correctly is extremely important. 

# Add your name to the file 
Use a text editor of your choice.

# Stage, commit, and push your changes
Use the add, commit, and push commands to do this. Add a message to your commit like "Adding firstname lastname to the attendance list" (-m flag).

# Merge your changes into the main branch
Make sure you have an up to date version of the main branch before pushing. Otherwise you will have merging issues, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. You can use the GitHub merge conflict GUI to resolve the issue, or you can pull the latest changes into your fork and then push. Create a pull request to merge your fork into the main version. Congratulations! You've completed the workshop!

# The end
Git is a critical tool for software engineers. Knowing the basics is important. You can learn more by practicing on your own. Use the site linked above or make your own repository and add branches, commit to them, and merge them. Have fun!
